The words are foreign and don't fit in her mouth, she is undeserving of such a title, because she has been nothing but a figurehead for her entire time in the executive branch. When Biden's standing in the party collapsed following his disastrous debate performance, she stood behind him. When Biden's approvals fell even further after the State of the Union, he expected her to stand behind him. But this time, with there being no way out of the upcoming disaster in the midterms, and the party in full revolt, she conceded to the baying mob. Her threat to invoke the 25th led to his historical resignation in December. <p> The guilt she feels under weighs the burden that has been thrust upon her. His staffers never meant you to be his successor, especially like this. As 2028 rushes closer and closer, it seems everything she has worked so hard for will be swept away under the tide of the MAGA Movement. But despite Congress trying to neutralize her, all is not yet lost.\n",

A popular swing state governor, a centrist in every sense of the word. Nearly as reviled as the likes of Newsom and your predecessor himself among the left flank, he does nothing to appeal to the younger, more idealistic of your base. With a moderate to almost conservative reputation as governor, he would have experience working along bipartisan lines. A skill that, with an increasingly uncooperative Republican Party, becomes more obsolete by the day. <p> But that doesn't matter, does it? Everyone knows why he's here. After the  party and media overthrew Biden, they wanted to extort Harris for all she had. They know she's desperate, she needed someone that the Republican Senate would let you pick. Most importantly, Shapiro is the way the party doesn't leave her for dead, the only way for its corporate backers to continue sending checks. Without them, Harris is cast into the unknown.\n",
